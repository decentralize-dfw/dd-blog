Digital Topographies is a sweeping exploration into what architecture could become when freed from the earthly constraints of gravity, weather and material scarcity. Conceived by Digital Forgery Workshop (DFW) and disseminated as a series of lightweight 3D models, this body of work functions both as a portfolio and as a provocative research project. It asks fundamental questions about the nature of space in the digital age: How does one design for avatars instead of bodies? How does one imbue intangible environments with atmosphere, orientation and meaning? How can architecture, liberated from the cost of bricks and mortar, serve cultural and social needs in the metaverse? The project’s guiding ethos—to “reimagine the borders and parameters of the spatial reflections of virtual daily life”—reminds us that spatial design is always a cultural act, even when the medium is code rather than concrete.


Rethinking spatial foundations

In the physical world, architecture is grounded in tectonics: walls hold up roofs, windows hold in heat, materials age and weather. For much of the discipline’s history, the architect’s role has been to reconcile human needs with the physics of the built environment. Digital architecture replaces tectonics with algorithms. In a virtual environment there is no gravity unless coded; materials never decay unless rendered; light is a shader rather than a beam of photons. This shift means that architects must reconsider their priorities. Instead of structural calculations, they must focus on performance metrics such as file size and rendering speed. Instead of specifying building codes, they must consider platform compatibility. Instead of thinking in terms of square metres, they must think in terms of polygons and textures.

Digital Topographies embraces this new foundation by treating its models as performative objects. Each space is designed to load quickly and run smoothly on a range of devices. The designers employ mesh optimisation, level of detail (LOD) strategies and efficient texture mapping to keep file sizes manageable. They choose glTF/GLB format because it supports PBR (physically based rendering) materials, which allow for realistic shading without heavy computational overhead. They also ensure that the models’ collision meshes are accurate so that avatars can interact with ramps, stairs and platforms without falling through. In short, the technical foundations of each model are as carefully considered as the aesthetic choices.


Typological diversity as a testbed
To investigate the full potential of metaverse architecture, DFW organises its work into thematic categories: galleries, multi‑purpose halls, headquarters, event venues, sculptural pavilions and retail environments. These categories are not rigid boxes but starting points for experimentation. By working within recognisable typologies, the designers can highlight the differences between physical and digital design without disorienting users. At the same time, the variety ensures that the project addresses a broad spectrum of activities that might occur in virtual worlds.


Spaces for art and culture

In the physical world, museums and galleries are often composed of rectilinear rooms connected by corridors. Lighting is controlled through skylights and fixtures; wall surfaces are carefully designed for the display of paintings or sculptures. Digital Topographies treats exhibition spaces as immersive narratives rather than static boxes. Some models lay out a continuous spiral that slowly climbs upward, with viewing platforms nested along the way. Others scatter exhibition pods across a floating plane, connected by translucent bridges. A few experiments invert the gallery entirely, placing artworks on the ceiling or embedding them within translucent walls. Without concerns about structural load or fire safety, the designers can position viewing decks in mid‑air or wrap an entire exhibition around a central void.


These exhibition spaces also harness dynamic lighting. Because the light sources in a virtual space can be animated or triggered by user proximity, the mood of a gallery can shift as a visitor moves. In some models, approaching an artwork causes surrounding lights to brighten and focus, while the rest of the space dims. In others, a general ambiance is created by environmental HDRI maps—panoramic images of nebulae, sunsets or dreamlike interiors—so that the space feels connected to a larger cosmos. All of this is possible because light is data rather than electricity.


Another innovation in the exhibition typology is the integration of sound and interactive media. Digital Topographies includes galleries in which soundscapes change based on the objects being viewed or the number of visitors present. Some models allow artworks themselves to trigger animations in the architecture: when a digital painting is selected, the walls might ripple or shift, emphasising the fluidity of the medium. This level of interactivity is rarely possible in physical museums, where conservation and safety concerns limit what can be done with infrastructure.


Multi‑purpose environments

Multi‑purpose halls in Digital Topographies are conceived as infrastructure for social gatherings, learning, markets and informal events. In physical buildings, multi‑purpose spaces often take the form of halls with retractable seating, stage lighting and movable partitions. In the metaverse, such requirements are replaced by an emphasis on modular programming and fluid movement. Some halls feature concentric circles of platforms connected by radial ramps, allowing activities to occur simultaneously at different elevations. Others are built as open grids of units that users can claim and customise. Without weight constraints, large overhangs and cantilevers become commonplace, creating covered plazas and mezzanines that float above open areas.


These spaces also address the need for orientation. Because users might enter from any direction, wayfinding is designed through colour gradients, guiding lines on the floor, or gradually shifting textures. In some models, a central landmark—a tower of light or a cluster of animated shapes—serves as an orientation marker visible from all parts of the hall. The designers incorporate signage and interface elements that hover in space, providing information without obstructing views. The result is an environment where a conference, a market and a dance party could occur simultaneously, each in its own zone yet visually connected.


Reimagining work and collaboration

The headquarters category explores the future of workspaces in virtual contexts. In the physical realm, corporate headquarters are often monolithic structures that symbolise stability and hierarchy. Digital Topographies rejects this symbolism. Its workspaces are composed of clusters of rooms and terraces that can be rearranged. Instead of cubicles and boardrooms, there are collaborative zones shaped like amphitheatres or lounges suspended in voids. Private meeting rooms are enclosed in transparent shells, allowing users to sense activity without hearing content. Social areas—cafés, gardens, lounges—are integrated into the work environment, acknowledging that spontaneous interaction is essential for creativity.


An important feature of these digital workspaces is the integration of external data. Virtual screens display live feeds, 3D charts or collaborative documents. Interactive tables allow users to manipulate data models in real time, mirroring the kind of gestures one might see in science fiction films. The architecture acts as both container and interface. Because the environment is digital, the boundaries between space and software disappear; walls become displays, floors become input surfaces. This integration is far easier in the metaverse than in physical buildings, where hardware must be physically mounted and replaced.


Stages and arenas

Event spaces in Digital Topographies are designed to challenge traditional notions of performance. In a concert hall or theatre in the physical world, a stage is elevated, and seating is oriented toward it. DFW’s digital arenas often remove this separation. Some models feature concentric rings where performers and audience members share the same plane, free to move around each other. Others create floating stages that can rotate or rearrange themselves during a performance. There are even event spaces inspired by natural forms: one model evokes a cavernous cave with stalactite‑like columns; another resembles a forest canopy with platforms suspended among branches.


Lighting in these spaces is highly dynamic. Stages can change colour, opacity and pattern in response to music or movement. Sound is spatialised so that each listener hears a slightly different mix depending on their position. The architecture acts as a musical instrument: ramps and bridges can reverberate with sound, and walls can glow or pulse. The focus is on creating immersive experiences that encourage participation rather than passive observation. The design of these event spaces also acknowledges the global nature of virtual audiences. Ramps and platforms are wide enough for large numbers of avatars; access points are multiple; stages are visible from many angles.


Sculptural exploration

The sculptural pavilions in Digital Topographies are exercises in formal and spatial freedom. Without a specific program, they become laboratories for experimenting with geometry, light and movement. Many of these structures expose frameworks that in the physical world would be hidden behind cladding. By weaving pipes, beams and ribbons in complex patterns, the designers create volumes that are simultaneously solid and void. Visitors can walk on these structures, traverse them like obstacles, or simply float through them, appreciating the interplay of lines and shadows.


Some pavilions explore the idea of infinite surfaces: a continuous band loops and twists, forming floors, walls and ceilings in one gesture. Others investigate modularity: a single unit is repeated, scaled and rotated to generate a dense field of structures. Because physical limitations are absent, scale is no obstacle. A pavilion might contain a giant sphere floating within a lattice, or a towering column of stacked rings. The aim is not to produce a habitable building but to explore how form can evoke emotions and provoke curiosity in the metaverse.


Commerce as experience

Retail environments in Digital Topographies treat shopping as a cultural narrative. Digital goods—whether fashion items, artworks or virtual services—are displayed in spaces that encourage storytelling. One model might feature a spiral ramp with niches for products, each accompanied by interactive panels that explain the item’s provenance. Another might embed the products within an environment that evokes their inspiration: a futuristic clothing line displayed in a crystalline cavern, or a series of handcrafted digital artefacts arranged in a digital forest.


These retail spaces prioritise immersion and education. Instead of static shelves, there are interactive pedestals that allow users to preview how a garment looks on their avatar or to see a 3D animation of how a gadget functions. Audio guides and holographic characters might welcome visitors, narrating the story of a brand. Payment is integrated through secure links to decentralised platforms, reflecting the project’s alignment with blockchain‑based commerce. By elevating the shopping environment into an experience, the designers hope to transform consumption into connection.


Structural logic and ornament

An overarching theme across all categories is the transformation of structure into ornament. In physical architecture, structural honesty is often admired—think of the exposed beams in a modernist house or the visible trusses in an airport terminal. DFW translates this honesty into digital form. In early works, lattices of ribs create soaring vaults reminiscent of Gothic cathedrals, but these ribs are freed from gravity and can form pyramids or spheres. Later explorations employ tubular networks that crisscross and enclose space, creating volumes defined by the spaces between pipes rather than by solid surfaces. In some models, a ring motif repeats at different scales: small rings form handrails; larger rings become walls; giant rings wrap around the entire structure.


This structural language is both practical and poetic. Practically, it provides a clear spatial order that helps users navigate. When a visitor sees a repeating pattern of rings or pipes, they understand where the boundaries are and where circulation paths might lead. Poetically, the exposed frameworks evoke metaphors: a nest of pipes suggests protection and enclosure; a lattice of beams evokes a web or network. This blending of function and symbolism embodies the project’s commitment to making virtual space legible and meaningful.


Narratives and metaphors without names

Although the project comprises dozens of individual models, their stories are woven together through shared metaphors rather than explicit references. Early pieces explore primal geometries: pyramidal forms with hollow centres, circular floors that ascend like shells, torus‑shaped complexes with internal courtyards. These forms resonate with ancient archetypes (pyramid, spiral, circle) but are reinterpreted as fluid and permeable. Mid‑period works investigate verticality: stacks of slabs wrapped by ramps, towers enclosed by cylindrical screens, and vertical runways that loop like Möbius strips. These vertical experiments challenge the notion of floor and ceiling. Later projects delve into spheres and networks: spherical rooms connected by tubes, clusters of globes that form modular complexes, and networks that sprawl like coral reefs. These evoke ideas of constellations, molecules and neural networks.


The use of metaphor extends to the user’s experience. A museum that slowly climbs upward might evoke a journey of growth. A workspace shaped like a branching tree suggests decentralisation and organic collaboration. A retail space arranged along a ribbon invites visitors to follow a storyline. An event hall inspired by a cave encourages intimacy and acoustics. By embedding these metaphors into the design, the spaces communicate their purpose and identity without the need for signage or explicit narrative.


Innovation and vision

Digital Topographies is innovative not only in its forms but also in its process and dissemination. By releasing models as glb files, the project democratizes access to high‑quality digital architecture. Artists, curators, educators and everyday users can download these spaces, place them in their own virtual worlds or modify them to suit their needs. Some models are available for purchase on decentralised platforms, hinting at a future in which virtual real estate is traded like digital art. This approach challenges traditional architectural practice, which often relies on client commissions and built projects for recognition and income.


The project also embodies a vision of architecture as an evolving conversation. Because the models are open and modifiable, they can spawn derivatives. A user might download a hall and adapt it for a community gallery, or take a pavilion and integrate it into a larger campus. DFW encourages this kind of remixing, seeing it as a way to build a shared vocabulary for virtual space. In doing so, the studio positions itself as a contributor to an emergent field rather than as the sole author of finished works. This open stance reflects the collaborative ethos of many digital communities.


Technical craft in detail

At the heart of Digital Topographies is a deep understanding of 3D modelling and optimisation. The designers build models using industry‑standard software, sculpting forms with nurbs and polygons, then refining them with mesh decimation to reduce unnecessary faces. They create UV maps to ensure that textures wrap correctly around complex geometries. When exporting, they embed texture images into the glb file to simplify loading. For lighting, they choose environment maps that provide global illumination without requiring heavy processing. Many models use baked lighting for static areas and real‑time lighting only where interactivity is needed, balancing visual quality and performance.


Interactive elements are scripted using JavaScript or in-platform languages. Buttons, sliders or hotspots respond to user actions, triggering animations or sound. For example, in one exhibition space, approaching a sculpture triggers a subtle rotation of the object and a change in ambient colour; in a retail space, selecting an item launches a preview window. Sound is implemented using spatial audio engines that simulate directionality. Footsteps echo differently depending on the height of the ceiling or the material of the floor. This attention to sensory detail enhances immersion and demonstrates the richness that digital architecture can achieve when technical craft is taken seriously.


Cultural and social implications revisited

The cultural impact of Digital Topographies is significant. Virtual spaces are increasingly important for social interaction, education, entertainment and commerce. By designing environments that emphasise inclusivity, creativity and participation, DFW contributes to shaping the norms of these spaces. The project challenges hierarchical spatial arrangements, encouraging egalitarian interactions. Stages are level with audience areas; offices open onto plazas; retail spaces invite exploration rather than passive browsing. This spatial democracy reflects values of openness and collaboration that many digital communities share.


At the same time, the project acknowledges inequalities in digital access. The designers optimise models for low‑end hardware, but they also recognise that not everyone has access to reliable internet or VR headsets. They see their work as part of a broader movement to make digital culture accessible to more people. By releasing their models freely or at low cost, they aim to lower economic barriers. However, the project also raises questions about who owns virtual spaces, who profits from them and how to ensure that digital commons are not enclosed by corporate interests. These questions are left open, inviting debate within the community.


The social dimension extends to the design of user interactions. Digital Topographies includes features that allow visitors to leave messages, curate temporary exhibitions or host events. Some models incorporate feedback mechanisms, enabling users to vote on future modifications or to request features. This participatory design approach aligns with the ethos of open-source software and decentralised governance. It suggests that architecture in the metaverse can be co‑created and evolved collectively.


Aesthetic richness and description

The visual language of Digital Topographies is diverse yet cohesive. Early works exhibit monochromatic palettes that highlight structural patterns. Stainless steel pipes, white concrete planes and translucent membranes dominate, creating an almost surgical aesthetic. Later pieces introduce more colour and texture. Some event spaces glow with neon hues, their surfaces shifting from purple to aqua. Retail environments might use warm hues and wood textures to evoke calm, while exhibition halls adopt cool tones and frosted surfaces for neutrality. Textures range from polished metal and rough stone to holographic gradients and animated patterns. Because the materials are digital, textures can do things that physical materials cannot: a floor might shimmer like water; a wall might display slowly moving stars; a ceiling might transform into a cloud when a user touches it.


Dynamic lighting further enriches the aesthetic experience. In some spaces, light sources move along tracks or change colour over time, painting the architecture with evolving hues. In others, light responds to user movement, creating interactive shadows. Reflective materials mirror and distort other parts of the space, producing kaleidoscopic views. The interplay of light and material is a key aspect of the project’s aesthetic, highlighting the possibilities of digital rendering.


Descriptions of these spaces often resort to metaphors because they defy easy classification. A gallery might feel like walking through a shell; a multi‑purpose hall like moving inside a beehive; a pavilion like traversing a giant musical instrument. These analogies help convey the sensory richness of the spaces. They also demonstrate the project’s commitment to creating environments that engage the senses holistically, not just visually. Sound, touch (through haptic feedback in some platforms) and even implied smell (through visual cues) are part of the experience.

Accessibility and user-centred design

Accessibility is both a technical and a design goal in Digital Topographies. On the technical side, the project ensures that models can be downloaded and run on devices with limited processing power. This is achieved through careful optimisation and by offering different versions of models—high fidelity for powerful systems and simplified versions for smartphones or web browsers. On the design side, spaces include ramps, lifts and wide passageways. Navigation relies on intuitive cues—contrasting textures, gently sloping paths, clear sightlines—rather than on text labels alone. For users with visual impairments, some models incorporate audio guidance or high‑contrast modes. For those with hearing impairments, captioning or visual cues accompany sound.


The user experience also extends to the ability to customise spaces. Many models are modular, allowing users to rearrange walls, insert new objects or change colour schemes. This adaptability ensures that spaces can meet diverse needs. For example, a work lounge can be converted into a lecture hall by flipping a few modules; a pavilion can host a wedding or a concert. Such flexibility is rare in physical architecture but vital in virtual environments where different communities share common infrastructure.


Overall impact and inspiration

Taken as a whole, Digital Topographies is both inspiring and instructive. It demonstrates that digital architecture is not simply about visual spectacle but about creating meaningful, functional and inclusive environments. The project shows how familiar typologies can be reimagined in ways that encourage new behaviours. It provides a blueprint for how architects might operate in digital contexts—embracing collaboration, sharing tools and iterating designs openly. It also sparks imagination about future possibilities: what might a digital library look like? How could a virtual university campus be designed? What is the digital equivalent of a public square?


By focusing on both theory and practice, the project bridges abstract thinking and concrete implementation. It invites further research into issues like digital equity, governance, sustainability (in terms of server energy and data storage) and cultural representation. It also sets a standard for quality in a realm where many early metaverse projects have been criticised for being visually crude or socially shallow. Digital Topographies counters this trend by demonstrating care, craft and critical thought.


The future of Digital Topographies

As the metaverse continues to mature, the concept of Digital Topographies is poised to evolve in parallel. One obvious trajectory is the integration of increasingly sophisticated technologies such as real‑time ray tracing, haptic feedback and artificial intelligence. Lighting engines that mimic global illumination and simulate subtle material properties will make virtual environments more convincing and emotionally resonant. Haptic devices will allow users to feel the texture of a wall or the weight of a virtual chair, narrowing the gap between digital and physical experience. Artificial intelligence could enable spaces to adapt themselves in response to user behaviour—expanding when crowd sizes grow, altering colour schemes based on mood, or even generating entire rooms on demand.


Another direction for the future lies in interoperability across platforms. Currently, many metaverse applications are siloed, with different file formats, avatar systems and economic models. For Digital Topographies to reach its full potential, models need to be portable across ecosystems. Initiatives like the Metaverse Standards Forum are working to create open protocols and standards, and DFW’s choice of glTF/GLB format already aligns with this movement. In the future, a gallery designed within this project could seamlessly be imported into a social VR platform, an educational AR application or a blockchain‑based world. Such interoperability will enable communities to curate and combine spaces, fostering hybrid environments that blend different typologies and uses.


The future may also bring deeper integration between digital and physical spaces. Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) allow virtual architecture to overlay onto physical sites. A museum exhibition could extend into a city square via AR, or a workplace designed in the metaverse could have a physical counterpart that mirrors its layout. This blending challenges the dichotomy between digital and physical architecture. DFW’s frameworks could inspire the design of flexible, modular physical structures that embrace similar patterns of connectivity and adaptability. Conversely, physical buildings could serve as anchor points for virtual layers, enriching them with additional narratives or functions.


Looking ahead, sustainability will be a growing concern. Server farms and network infrastructure consume energy, and the carbon footprint of digital experiences is not negligible. Designers will need to consider the energy cost of rendering complex models and the environmental impact of perpetually running virtual worlds. Solutions might include optimising code for energy efficiency, using more sustainable servers, or encouraging time‑limited experiences rather than always‑on worlds. Digital Topographies has already demonstrated how optimisation can reduce file size and processing demands; future iterations could incorporate metrics for energy use and provide guidelines for sustainable virtual design.


Finally, the future of Digital Topographies will likely involve more participatory creation. Community members could collaborate on new spaces through version control systems similar to those used in software development. Forks and branches of original models might proliferate, creating a family tree of designs. Governance mechanisms—whether on a blockchain or through a cooperative platform—could enable users to vote on the evolution of shared spaces. This participatory future aligns with the project’s ethos of openness and suggests that architecture in the metaverse will become less about singular authorship and more about collective stewardship.


NFT marketplace valuation potential

One of the most provocative aspects of Digital Topographies is its connection to blockchain technology and non‑fungible tokens (NFTs). By tokenising virtual spaces, the project raises questions about value, ownership and scarcity in the digital realm. At the heart of NFT valuation is the notion of uniqueness and provenance. Just as a physical building’s location and design contribute to its real‑estate value, a digital space’s design, use‑case and community significance could determine its worth. A well‑crafted gallery that becomes a hub for digital art might acquire cultural cachet and, consequently, market value.


The potential valuation of digital architecture NFTs depends on multiple factors. The technical quality and aesthetic appeal of a model will influence collectors and investors. If a space is built with efficient geometry, high‑quality textures and strong narrative themes, it will stand out in a crowded marketplace. Utility is another key factor. Spaces that offer functionality—such as hosting events, supporting multi‑user interactions or integrating with social platforms—will be more attractive to buyers. Provenance and rarity will play a role: a space created by a respected studio like DFW, especially if it is a one‑of‑a‑kind or limited edition, may command higher prices.


Market perception also hinges on the broader adoption of virtual worlds. If the metaverse becomes a significant venue for commerce, entertainment and socialising, demand for well‑designed virtual real estate could surge. Conversely, if the metaverse remains niche, the market could be limited to collectors and enthusiasts. The interplay between digital and physical value perceptions will be crucial. In the art world, digital artworks with strong narratives and reputable creators have achieved high valuations. Digital architecture could follow a similar path, especially if these spaces become iconic meeting places or venues for high‑profile events.


However, there are also risks. The NFT market has been volatile, with periods of rapid appreciation followed by steep corrections. Value is often speculative and influenced by hype. There is a danger that investors might treat digital architecture as a short‑term asset rather than as a long‑term cultural resource. Regulatory uncertainties around digital property, intellectual‑property rights and taxation could also affect valuations. Additionally, issues of accessibility and inclusivity arise: if only wealthy investors can own and control desirable virtual spaces, the egalitarian potential of the metaverse might be undermined. To mitigate these risks, DFW and similar creators might explore models such as fractional ownership, where multiple stakeholders share rights and responsibilities, or cooperative governance structures that prioritise community use over speculation.


Looking ahead, the NFT marketplace could evolve to recognise the intrinsic social and cultural value of digital architecture. Spaces that foster vibrant communities, host meaningful events or embody particular historical moments could become digital heritage sites. Their value would not only be measured in cryptocurrency but also in the stories and memories they hold. As standards emerge for evaluating and preserving digital spaces, and as mainstream audiences become more familiar with virtual real estate, the potential for sustainable valuation will grow. Digital Topographies situates itself at the forefront of this emerging market, inviting discussions about how we assign value to places that exist only in code.


The effect of Digital Topographies on mainstream architecture

If the ideas embedded in Digital Topographies were embraced by mainstream architecture, the ripple effects would be significant. In academia, curricula would expand to include courses on digital space design, 3D modelling optimisation, and metaverse ethics. Students would be encouraged to think beyond site plans and building codes, exploring how user interfaces, network performance and immersive storytelling intersect with architectural design. Studios would require skills in programming and game engines alongside model building. This would create a generation of architects comfortable operating across physical and digital domains.


In practice, architectural firms might integrate metaverse work into their portfolios, offering clients both physical and virtual environments. A cultural institution could commission a digital gallery alongside its physical extension; a corporation could request a virtual headquarters to complement its real offices. This dual approach would provide users with continuous engagement regardless of location. The experiential design methods developed in Digital Topographies—such as dynamic lighting, responsive soundscapes and modular layouts—could inform physical projects as well. We might see physical buildings with more porous boundaries, flexible interiors and embedded digital layers that respond to occupants in real time.


A mainstream embrace would also influence regulatory and professional frameworks. Building codes, zoning laws and professional licensure could evolve to address digital projects. Questions about liability, accessibility standards and intellectual property in virtual spaces would require new policies. Architects might be tasked with ensuring not only physical safety but also data privacy and inclusivity. Professional organisations could adopt guidelines for virtual design ethics, sustainability and cultural sensitivity.


Beyond practice, the cross‑pollination of ideas could transform architectural aesthetics. Physical structures might take inspiration from the expressive frameworks of virtual pavilions, incorporating lattices, rings and fluid forms that were previously impractical. Conversely, digital projects might draw on tactile qualities of materials, adopting simulated textures and light qualities that evoke stone, wood or fabric. The interplay between digital and physical could lead to hybrid typologies—buildings that exist simultaneously in both realms, each influencing the other. For instance, a stadium might have a physical structure with embedded AR overlays that extend seating capacity or offer alternative views; a museum might host simultaneous exhibitions in its halls and in a virtual twin.


Finally, the cultural perception of architecture could expand. As more people experience well‑designed virtual spaces, they may demand higher quality and more thoughtful design in physical environments. The accessibility ethos of Digital Topographies—wide ramps, inclusive circulation, open participation—could pressure developers to adopt similar values. The focus on community and narrative in digital design might inspire physical architects to incorporate storytelling and participatory elements. Overall, mainstream recognition of Digital Topographies would blur the line between architecture and digital media, positioning architects not only as builders but also as experience designers.


User agency and co‑creation in the metaverse

A critical yet often underexplored aspect of digital architecture is the agency afforded to users. Traditional buildings are mostly fixed; occupants adapt their behaviour to the space. In contrast, virtual environments can adapt to the users. Digital Topographies hints at this potential by publishing modifiable models, but the conversation can go further. In a truly user‑centric metaverse, visitors might be able to alter spaces in real time—adding a platform for a meeting, adjusting lighting for mood or rearranging modules to create a dance floor. Such modifications could be temporary or saved as personalised versions of a space.


Co‑creation transforms the role of the designer into that of a facilitator. The designer provides tools, modules and guidelines rather than a finished composition. Users become active participants in shaping the environment. This participatory approach could mirror practices in open-source software, where contributors fork and merge projects. A digital gallery could have numerous versions curated by different communities; a workplace could be configured differently by various teams. Governance structures would be needed to manage these variations—mechanisms for voting, moderation and consensus. Smart contracts on blockchains could automate permissions and rights, ensuring that changes are traceable and reversible.


The implications of such agency extend to social dynamics. Spaces that users can shape are more likely to engender a sense of ownership and belonging. They become social commons rather than mere services. However, co‑creation also raises questions about quality control and coherence. If everyone can modify a space, how do you prevent visual chaos or functional breakdown? Solutions could include tiered editing rights, where trusted members have more influence, or sandboxed areas where experimentation can occur without impacting the core environment.


User agency also relates to identity and expression. In digital spaces, avatars are the primary vehicles for self‑presentation. Architecture can complement or challenge these identities. A flexible environment allows users to host events that reflect their interests or cultures, decorate spaces with symbols meaningful to them or embed narratives relevant to their communities. This kind of personalisation fosters diversity and representation, making the metaverse more inclusive. It also encourages cross‑cultural exchange, as users experience spaces designed or modified by others.


Lastly, co‑creation can be a catalyst for learning. As users tinker with layouts or lighting, they gain insights into architectural principles—how circulation works, how scale affects perception, how light influences mood. Digital Topographies, with its emphasis on structural logic and narrative, provides an educational template. If accompanied by tutorials or mentor communities, these models could become tools for teaching design and spatial thinking. Empowering users to be creators not only enriches the metaverse but also democratizes the knowledge of architecture itself.



Conclusion
As virtual worlds become more prevalent, the design of digital spaces will play a crucial role in shaping social, cultural and economic life. Digital Topographies is an early yet comprehensive effort to define what this design could look like. By exploring a wide range of typologies, elaborating a language of structural ornament, integrating narrative and metaphor, attending to technical optimisation, emphasising accessibility and inviting user participation, the project lays a foundation for future explorations. It encourages architects to engage with technology not as a threat to their craft but as an expanded medium. It challenges developers to think like designers, considering how software architecture can shape human experience. And it invites users to see themselves as co‑creators, not just consumers, of digital space. Above all, Digital Topographies embodies the belief that architecture—whether built or coded—should aim to enrich life, foster community and inspire imagination
